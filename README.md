# Cloudflare-Worker-Reverse-Proxy
This Worker proxies incoming requests to a Cloudflare Tunnel origin by rewriting the request URL and forwarding the original method, headers, and body. It enables you to expose remote services through a stable Cloudflare Worker endpoint while keeping the origin hidden and protected behind a tunnel.
